This repository contains the **IoT Simulator** for the PK4U system. This service is a critical component for testing and demonstration, designed to mimic the behavior of real-world IoT sensors in parking lots. Its main responsibilities are:

-   Periodically fetching the list of all available parkings from the **PK4U Backend**.
-   Randomly selecting parking spots and changing their occupancy status (from free to occupied and vice versa).
-   Publishing these status changes as messages to a **RabbitMQ** queue.
-   Registering itself with the **Eureka Server** to be part of the microservice ecosystem.

## üöÄ Local Deployment

Follow these steps to run the Simulator service locally.

### **üìã Prerequisites**

-   **JDK 21** (or the version specified in the `pom.xml`).
-   **Maven** or **Gradle** for dependency management and project building.

### **1. External Dependencies** üì¶

For the Simulator to function correctly, it needs to connect to the following services, which must be running first:

-   ‚úÖ **Eureka Server**: To register itself and discover other services.
-   ‚úÖ **PK4U Backend**: To fetch the list of parkings and spots to simulate.
-   ‚úÖ **RabbitMQ**: The message broker where spot status updates will be sent.

### **2. Clone the Repository ‚¨áÔ∏è**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MMunozLo/Simulator.git
cd Simulator
```

### 3. Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è
The application's configuration is managed in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file. Ensure that the connection properties for databases and external services are correct for your local environment.

Example `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8083 # Port for the Simulator service

spring:
  application:
    name: simulator-ms # Service name to register in Eureka
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
    username: guest
    password: guest

# URL of the PK4U Backend to fetch parkings, can be direct or via Gateway
pk4u:
  backend:
    url: http://localhost:8081/api/v1 

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka # URL of your Eureka Server
```

### 4. Running the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
You can run the application using the Maven or Gradle plugin.

With Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

With Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Once started, the service will register with **Eureka** and begin periodically sending messages to **RabbitMQ**, simulating real-time parking activity.

### 5. Running the Full System üåê
Keep in mind that the frontend is only the **presentation layer** of the PK4U system. for full functionality, you need to have all the backend services running.

Make sure to clone and run the following repositories in the recommended order:

| Order | Component             | Description                                                                                          | Repository                                                                    |

|   6   | **PK4U Frontend** | Presentation layer of the PK4U system developed with React, Vite and TailwindCSS              | [pk4u-frontend](https://github.com/Jefffer/pk4u-frontend)                   |

## üåü What is PK4U?

In modern cities, finding parking has become a daily challenge that causes stress and unnecessarily increases traffic and pollution. This phenomenon, known as _cruising for parking_, negatively affects the quality of life and urban sustainability.

**PK4U** was created to address this problem by offering an open-source solution that centralizes and displays real-time parking availability in a city. Our platform unifies data from multiple parking facilities into a single interface with interactive maps, empowering drivers to make better decisions and contributing to smarter, more sustainable mobility.
